# House_Sales_EDA
Performing EDA on House Sales Price data


Performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset. We'll address the following points:

1. Missing Values
2. Numerical Variables
3. Distribution of Numerical Variables
4. Categorical Variables
5. Outliers
6. Relationship Between Independent and Dependent Features
7. Correlation
   
1. Missing Values
We'll identify columns with missing values and the percentage of missing data in each column.

2. Numerical Variables
We'll list all numerical variables in the dataset.

3. Distribution of Numerical Variables
We'll visualize the distribution of numerical variables to understand their spread and central tendency.

4. Categorical Variables
We'll list all categorical variables in the dataset.

5. Outliers
We'll identify outliers in numerical variables using box plots.

6. Relationship Between Independent and Dependent Features
We'll explore how independent features relate to the target variable SalePrice.

7. Correlation
We'll calculate and visualize the correlation matrix for numerical features to identify highly correlated features.
